# Recruitment-process---coding-tasks
I participated in recruitment coding skill test, this is the code that I wrote to solve given problems.

Just bear in mind that this code is after some refactoring, orginal was different but did the same job. I was under time stress and watching person pressure...

#The tasks was:

I got 60 minutes to solve it. Codeing interviewer was seeing my screen via skype screen share. 
I could use internet, tools and programming languages I like (but most likely it was all about C#)

Three .csv files was given with names like: Set1_1.csv, Set1_2.csv, Set2.csv

Tasks was like this:
#1 Compare Set1_1 with Set1_2.
Return not-matched results. 
#2 Merge Set1_1 with Set1_2.
Return combined results. 
#3 Find any person from Set2 with a name that is in the result of #2.

#To sum up
I finished  all three tasks in 1 hour 10 minutes. Overal score given to me by interviewer was 8/10 which is very high score in my opinion.
It was very stressful for me as I never been in such situation. Overall I am very happy with the outcome.
